    "Assignment Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "You have been tasked to design and implement a program that will perform some basic arithmetic calculations.\n",
    "System Requirements\n",
    "• Your program should present the user with a menu that contains all the operations that the user will be allowed to perform. \n",
    "\n",
    "These options are:\n",
    "o Addition (of n numbers)\n",
    "o Subtraction (only two inputs) \n",
    "o Multiplication (of n numbers) \n",
    "o Division (only two inputs)\n",
    "o Close the program\n",
    "\n",
    "• Then the program should allow the user to select any of the operations from the menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "• For addition and multiplication, the program should ask the user how many numbers they\n",
    "want to add/multiply. Depending on this input, then the program should allow the user to type\n",
    "in, one by one, the elements of the operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "• In the case of subtraction and division, the program should allow the user to type in, one by\n",
    "one, the two elements of the operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Once the user has completed the corresponding inputs, the result of the operation should be\n",
    "displayed, followed by the original menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "• The program should allow the user to perform multiple operations without having to run the\n",
    "program again.\n",
    "\n",
    "• At every stage of the program, for every user input, validations must be implemented.\n",
    "• If the last option is selected, the program should finish.\n",
    "• Your source code must be properly commented, and a reasonable explanation of your logic\n",
    "should be included. This explanation can be short and simple, but clear enough to demonstrate your understanding of your own code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes\n",
    "• Your program should make use of different data structures to store inputs/outputs as needed. As well as loops (for and/or while) and flow control structures.\n",
    "• Using multiple functions is recommended to organise your code and avoid repetition.\n",
    "• Keep in mind that dividing any number by zero is not mathematically possible -so you should\n",
    "validate against it.\n"
